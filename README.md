# VIPER
Example viper arch for ios. The example must show a list of locations, each one can be accesed to see what weather is doing now. 

To run this project you need to create an [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) api key, after that create a file called constants like that:
```objective-c
#ifndef Constants_h
#define Constants_h

#define API_KEY @"INSERT YOUR API KEY"

#endif /* Constants_h */

```
